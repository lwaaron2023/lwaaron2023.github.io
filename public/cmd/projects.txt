b.	Developing a csv writer and reader to create and read in database backups
c.	Creating components and displays in the front end to fetch and present analytics to the user
d.	Applying DFS and Dijkstra’s algorithms for path finding
e.	Designing graph and node interfaces used in pathfinding following the component design pattern

Machine Learning Final Project, WPI

1. Scraped 10 years of stock data from Yahoo Finance

2. Implemented a sliding window algorithm to annotate the data, then split the data into training and testing data

3. Used PyTorch and Tensorflow to create a GRU model with Adam optimization to predict the adjusted closing price for the stock for the next 7 trading days, given the last 30 trading days

4. Fined tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model

5. Was 10-100 times more accurate in predictions than the baseline model created by copilot
